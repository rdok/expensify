# Expensify
![Deployment](https://github.com/rdok/expensify/workflows/prod-deploy/badge.svg) ![test](https://github.com/rdok/expensify/workflows/test/badge.svg)

### Dev Flow
- use `make lint-watch` to auto style
- use `make test-watch` to auto test
- Interact through docker for the rest. E.g. for install node packages; haven't figured out a way for make to accept arguments in a nice way.

See `Makefile` for more.
